#### readme - script ####
# script is based on paper of Singmann
# packages used: afex, function mixed
#   --> calls either lme4 or glmer, depending on the family and reports p values (lmertest()))
#   --> per default: Type 3 sums of squares (recommended by Singmann)
# 
# general model format:
#   fixed effects: Exp, HMI & Interaction Exp:HMI
#   random effects: TC (random intercept & slopes for HMI) & VP (random intercept)
#   --> afex::mixed(ER_score ~ Exp*HMI + (HMI|TC) + (1|VP), data_12_VP_l)
#   
# depending on the format of the dependent data, the famiy and the method (for obtaining p values) is chosen:
#   --> for family = "gaussian" --> default method: "S"
#       for continuous decimal data with normal distribution, like weight, length, et al
#       model <- afex::mixed(AV ~ Exp*HMI + (HMI|TC) + (1|VP), data) --- calls lme4
#   --> for family = "poisson" --> method: "PB" | alternative "LRT" is not recommended, because TC has <40 factor levels
#       for positive integer or small natural number like count, individual number, frequency
#       model <- afex::mixed(AV ~ Exp*HMI + (HMI|TC) + (1|VP), data, method = "PB", family = "poisson") --- calls glmer
#   --> for family = "binomial" --> method: "PB" | alternative "LRT" is not recommended, because TC has <40 factor levels
#       binary data like 0 and 1, or proportion like survival number vs death number, positive frequency vs negative frequency, 
#       winning times vs the number of failtures, et alâ€¦
#       model <- afex::mixed(AV ~ Exp*HMI + (HMI|TC) + (1|VP), data, method = "PB", family = "binomial") --- calls glmer

#### readme - Comments to model structure ####
#     factors of interest: exp + HMI
#     other pot. influencing factors: TC (different situations, different variances!) & VP (grouping variable)
#                                     potentially Age & gender, or even other sd variables, 
#                                     but not of interest, too complicated and (partially) incl. in VP
# other model structures:
#   tested with AV ER_score
# produce errors/not possible with data 
# afex::mixed(ER_score ~ Exp*HMI + (Exp*HMI|VP:TC), data_12_VP_l) # error
# afex::mixed(ER_score ~ Exp*HMI + (Exp*HMI|TC:VP), data_12_VP_l) # error
# afex::mixed(ER_score ~ Exp*HMI + (Exp*HMI|VP/TC), data_12_VP_l) # error
# afex::mixed(ER_score ~ Exp*HMI + (Exp*HMI|TC/VP), data_12_VP_l) # error
# afex::mixed(ER_score ~ Exp*HMI + (Exp*HMI|TC) + (1|VP:TC), data_12_VP_l) # error
